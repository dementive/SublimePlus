# Package Dev Syntaxes

This folder contains the syntaxes for all default sublime text files made for [Package Dev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev)

This is basically a "mini" version of package dev that doens't contain all the extra commands or any scripts, but only contains the syntaxes that are very useful when making packages or editing any sublime files. The syntaxes here include:

- Build System files
- Color Scheme files
- Commands files
- Completions files
- Keymap files
- Macro files
- Menu files
- Mousemap files
- Project files
- Settings files
- Snippet files
- Syntax definition files (both Sublime Text and TextMate)
- TextMate Preferences (.tmPreferences)

Package dev also adds many snippets and completions to these file types to make editing them very easy.

## Additional Package

I highly reccomend downloading [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) and installing with it [LSP-json](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-json) most of these file types are json based and the JSON language server provides great support for sublime text.
